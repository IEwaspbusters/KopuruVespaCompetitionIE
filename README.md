# KopuruVespaCompetitionIE
IE Business School team (WaspBusters) for the [**2021 Kopuru Vespa Velutina**](https://kopuru.com/desafio/vespa-velutina/) data science competition.

This is the script+data workflow followed for each submission:
![WaspBusters workflow](https://github.com/IEwaspbusters/KopuruVespaCompetitionIE/raw/main/Competition_subs/Beeswax.jpg "THE BEESWAX is the glue that keeps it all together")

This is the Git workflow used by the team:
1. All scripts and data go in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/IEwaspbusters/KopuruVespaCompetitionIE)
2. Use JupyterLab locally and install the @jupyterlab/git extension using the ["Install" instructions here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git). Note that some additional installations are sometimes required such as the latest version of Git, Conda, JupyterLab, etc.
3. **"Clone"** this repository in your local JupyterLab environment
4. Before editing, make sure you always **"Pull from remote"** the latest version of the repo
5. Edit whatever script and data you need in the corresponding submission and batch folder. **.IPYNB** files are preferred in most cases
6. **STAGE** any _Changed_ or _Untracked_ files (by clickking on the "+") that you want to commit (i.e. "save")
7. Write a short Summary of the changes you are introducing and then click **Commit**
8. Now **Push to remote** the commit you just made to see them reflected in [the WaspBuster's GitHub repo](https://github.com/IEwaspbusters/KopuruVespaCompetitionIE)
